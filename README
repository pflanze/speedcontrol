dvdspeedcontrol: set the speed of DVD-drives

This tool for Linux (tested on Debian) was originally written by
Thomas Fritzsche, http://noto.de, and I found it through some forum
posts, some of which with (modified) copies. I've collected this
information here (see Git history), and have renamed the tool from
speedcontrol to dvdspeedcontrol to make it enough to remember "dvd"
then hit the tab key to find it through autocompletion; also, the
original program description already explicitely said it is for
DVD-drives.

The tool does not seem to be on noto.de anymore, so I'm pushing this
to Github as possible primary location or for whomever would like to
add changes, or if I don't respond, take over maintenance (preferably
by forking it on Github[1]).

Installation: just run "make install" (edit the Makefile to change the
target).

Note: speed settings persist only for the currently inserted disc (at
least with my hardware).
